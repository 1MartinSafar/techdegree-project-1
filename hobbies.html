        <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
        <h3 class="hobbies">English</h3>
        <p>Besides Web Development, I love improving my English (focusing primarily on American English - though I am familiar with British English as well).</p>
        <p>A few years ago I have received the Cambridge English: Advanced (CAE) certificate. I am determined to master the language sooner or later.</p>
        <p>Learning English is also how I was introduced to the concept of self-studying which I have been using ever since then; for English, Web Development and more.</p>
        <h3 class="hobbies">Spanish</h3>
        <p>I have recently started studying Spanish (focusing on "Universal" Spanish (not specific to a particular region) at the moment).</p>
        <p>Going with Spain Spanish pronunciation for now due to currently living in Europe.</p>
        <h3 class="hobbies">Traveling</h3>
        <p>I like visiting new places and meeting new people. I have been traveling in Europe.</p>
        <p>For example: Spain, Italy, France, England and Monaco. I would love to travel to the USA in near future.</p>
        <h3 class="hobbies">Video Games</h3>
        <p>Video Games: I have tried and enjoyed a wide range of game genres starting as a child.</p>
        <p>Here are a few examples of genres and games if you're curious: <br>
          <br> FPS (Counter-Strike: Global Offensive)<br>
          <br> RTS (StarCraft II)<br>
          <br> MMORPG (World of Warcraft)<br>
          <br> MOBA (League of Legends)<br>
          <br> Sandbox (Minecraft)<br>
          <br> Platform/Puzzle (Trine 2)<br>
          <p>I started out playing mostly single-player games with friends (we enjoyed role-playing and even "creating" our own versions of the character's story or the story in general).</p>
          <p>After being introduced to online FPS games and MMORPGs I was very excited about the idea of people cooperating together both against the AI or other players).</p>
          <p>I have been switching games and genres a lot throughout my life, trying different things, styles, approach and thinking.</p>

        <h2>Resources</h2>
        <h3>Here are some of the materials and sources I used for my hobbies</h3>
        <p>English Pronunciation: if you want to improve your American English pronunciation, you can try Rachel's English on youtube (she also wrote a book - in case you like her videos and want a structured learning process)</p>
        <a href="http://rachelsenglish.com/" class="resources" target="_blank">Rachel's English<img src="images/rachels-english.jpg" alt="Rachel's English Logo" class="logo-wide"></a>
        <p>English Grammar/Vocab/General: I really like "English Lessons with Adam", a Canadian professional English teacher who can explain things in a clear and fun way. And obviously using an online dictionary such as Cambrige (using a dictionary might seem difficult, unnecessary or frustrating for people who are not used to it but trust me, it'll be very easy in no time and it really is worth it)</p>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/EnglishTeacherAdam" class="resources" target="_blank">English Lessons with Adam <br> <img src="images/adam.jpg" alt="English Lessons with Adam Logo" class="logo-small"></a>
        <a href="http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/" class="resources" target="_blank">Cambridge Dictionary <br> <img src="images/cambridge-dictionary.jpg" alt="Cambridge Dictionary Logo" class="logo-small"></a>
        <p>Spanish: My current approach to learning Spanish is using Duolingo to write down (e.g. in Word) words and use a dictionary such as SpanishDict to take notes on many (or all) the meanings rather than purely limiting myself to Duolingo meanings of the words only - plus a dictionary helps you understand the use of different prepositions in-depth. I highly suggest you divide the words into categories such as: Verb, El Nouns (masculine), La Nouns (feminine) and Others (here go adjectives/adverbs/prepositions/etc.) - doing it this way makes it a lot easier not to get overwhelmed by mixing nouns with other meanings (there may be many meanings for nouns and many meanings/uses as a different type - creating a huge block of information that's very hard to go through word by word)</p>
